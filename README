This is a fork of Chris Rosebrughs awesome ObjectLoader, who have written it in SDL(1) and c++.
He is formerly known as "thecplusplusuy" on Youtube. Watch his Channel! - He is an outstanding c++ Programmer and can explain his code very well!: http://www.youtube.com/user/thecplusplusguy
I think he has used a Mac. Because I want to use SDL2 in my Project, i had to migrate his code, and modify it a little to also work on Linux. Also I added a Makefile for simpler compiling (with g++).

So this Repository is is a c++/SDL2 (!) fork for instant use to load and view Alias Wavefront .obj Files.

Read the Wiki/F.A.Q if you run in tropuble!
