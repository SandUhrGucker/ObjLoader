This is a fork of Chris Rosebrughs awesome ObjeLoader, who have written it in SDL(1) and c++.
He is formerly known as "thecplusplusuy" on Youtube. Watch his Channel! - He is an outstanding c++ Programmer and can explain his code very well!: http://www.youtube.com/user/thecplusplusguy
I think he has used a Mac. Because I want to use SDL2 in my Project, i had to migrate his code, and modify it a little to also work on Linux. Also I added a Makefile for simpler compiling (with g++).

So this Repository is is a c++/SDL2 (!) fork for instant use to load and view Alias Wavefront .obj Files.

Hint if you get Memory/Segfaults:
Pay attention on a corect Blender-Export of your Object- & Material-File!
If You're still in trouble, take a look at your syslog (/var/log/syslog), and use strace (apt-get install strace)
